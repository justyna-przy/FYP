# Notes

## Intrusive Thoughts
- Are Plovers fitting my woodland dataset? 
- I'm going to keep gulls because I'm a big gull fan.
- I fucking love ravens
- Really funny that the rarer the bird, the more audio you can find.
    - Only 200 rock dove recordings? 
- Holy shit there are so many warblers
- I'm actually laughing so much at these scientific names:
    - Troglodytes troglodytes
    - Pica pica
- Not many Bluethoats spotted but im keeping them cause they look cool 
- "The New World warblers are a group of small, often colourful, passerine birds restricted to the New World." 
    - What is the new world?!!! Is this Agartha??
